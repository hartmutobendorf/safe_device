Flutter (Null-Safety) Jailbroken, root, emulator and mock location detection.

## Getting Started

In your flutter project add the dependency:

```yml
dependencies:
  ...
  safe_device: ^1.0.7
```


## Usage
#### Importing package
```
import 'package:safe_device/safe_device.dart';
```
#### Using it

Checks whether device JailBroken on iOS/Android?
```
bool isJailBroken = await SafeDevice.isJailBroken;
```
Checks whether device is real or emulator
```
bool isRealDevice = await SafeDevice.isRealDevice;
```
Can this device mock location - no need to root!
```
bool canMockLocation = await SafeDevice.canMockLocation;
```
(ANDROID ONLY) Check if application is running on external storage
```
bool isOnExternalStorage = await SafeDevice.isOnExternalStorage;
```
Check if device violates any of the above
```
bool isSafeDevice = await SafeDevice.isSafeDevice;
```

# Note:
#### Mock location detection
* **Android** - Location permission needs to be granted in app in order to detect mock location properly
* **iOS** - For now we are checking if device is Jail Broken or if it's not real device. There is no strong detection of mock location in iOS *(Open the PR if you have better way for mock location detection in iOS)*

## ❗Since emulators are usually rooted, you might want to bypass these checks during development. Unless you're keen on constant false alarms ⏰
